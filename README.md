## Generating Access Keys

To generate Access Keys, log in to your dashboard at https://beta.bons.ai. Once there, click on the down arrow next to your user name in the upper right. Click **Account Settings**. 

On the Account Settings page, click the **Access Keys** tab. 

After the page loads, click on the **New Access Key** link. This will generate a new access key to be used with the [Bonsai command line tool](https://github.com/BonsaiAI/bonsai-cli).
